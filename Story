Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a plum tree which was underbanks of the river. 
In the same forest, there lived a crocodile and his wife. 

One day, the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
The next day, the crocodile came back for more fruits as he loved them. As the
days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
